# redux-infinity-state

## A package for state management of react redux applications

### Motivation

### Motivação

We know that redux is important part of react ecosystem further if application have a complex flux and asynchronous actions.
With redux the management state and data synchronization between components is easy peasy.

But in many cases the exceeding code around redux ecosystem
is boring and tiring. The sensation increases when we discovery that codes is repetitive especially when create many actions and actions type.

Another factor that discourages the use redux is when you need deal with asynchronous flux, in these cases is necessary at least one library for this job. Redux-Saga, Redux-Thunk or Redux-Observable are good solutions and do this job very well, but the synchronous part keep parted of asynchronous and it make sense, but the code keep confuse and not natural.


### The approach propose

The redux-infinity-state come to try solve these 

O redux-infinity-state vem para tentar resolver esses dois pontos e tornar o uso do redux mais simples e deixar o código organizado de forma mais logica.
